# AppointDoc

This is a professional-grade MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack web application for booking doctor appointments. Patients can browse through a list of doctors and their availability and book an appointment with their preferred doctor. Doctors can view their schedule, manage their availability, and approve/cancel appointments.




## Usage

- The AppointDoc application allows doctors to manage their appointments with ease. Doctors can create new appointments, view existing appointments, and approve or reject appointments as necessary.

- To create a new appointment, the user needs to click on the "New Appointment" button on the doctor's card. They will then be presented with a form where they can enter the details of the appointment, including date and time.

- To view existing appointments, the doctor needs to click on the "Appointments" button on the sidebar. They will then be presented with a list of all their appointments, presented by date and time. The doctor can click on any appointment to approve or reject to change it's pending status.

- To update time of availability, the doctor needs to click on the profile page where they wish to update the time of appointments. They will then be presented with a form where they can edit the start time and end time details of the appointment.
